🌱 Predicting Plant Growth Stages with Environmental and Management Data Using Power BI

📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to analyze and visualize the relationship between irrigation patterns, soil types, environmental factors, and plant growth. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights for smart farming practices by identifying key influencers of plant growth such as temperature, humidity, sunlight, and fertilizer type.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following fields:

Soil: Type of soil (clay, sandy, loam)
Water Frequency: Irrigation frequency (daily, weekly, bi-weekly)
Humidity: Average humidity level
Sunlight: Amount of sunlight (hours/day)
Temperature: Average temperature (°C)
Fertilizer Type: (organic, chemical, none)
Total_Growth: Plant growth milestone/score

📌 Key Insights

🌡️ Temperature is a key influencer: A decrease in temperature below 60.59 leads to a decrease in plant growth by an average of 1.76 points.
💧 Humidity has a positive correlation with plant growth — higher humidity values tend to result in better growth.
🌱 Fertilizer type impacts growth: Organic fertilizers contribute the most to growth milestones (39.58%), followed by chemical (37.5%) and none (22.92%).
🧱 Soil type comparison: Clay soil leads to the highest total growth, followed by sandy and loam.
📈 Visuals Included
